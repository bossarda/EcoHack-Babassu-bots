Keywords: C.F.P. von Martius Medicinal plants Amazon Historical records Brazil

Ethnopharmacological relevance: Information regarding the use of beneﬁcial, native Brazilian plants was compiled by European naturalists during the 19th century. The German botanist C.F.P. von Martius was one of the most prominent naturalists and described the use of several Brazilian plants. Aim of the study: To present data on Amazonian medicinal plants documented by von Martius in his books. Materials and methods: Data on Amazonian medicinal plants were obtained from three books published by von Martius. Traditional information about these plants was translated from Latin and the cited plant species reorganised according to current taxonomic criteria. Correlated pharmacological studies were obtained from different scientiﬁc databases. Results: A total of 92 native medicinal species from the Amazon were recorded in von Martius’ books. These accounts described 117 different medical uses for these plants. Several parts of the plants were used, including many exudates. The principal use of the species recorded was the treatment of dermatological problems, followed by gastro-intestinal, urinary and respiratory disorders. Few species were recorded as purgatives and febrifuges, a result that differs from the observations of other naturalists. The efﬁcacy of the recorded traditional uses has been conﬁrmed for the few species that have been subjected to laboratory studies. Conclusion: The data recorded by the German naturalist von Martius represent a rich, unexplored source of information about the traditional uses of Brazilian plants. & 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction

Brazil became a Portuguese colony in 1500 and this period produced important records of the use of plants by native Brazilians. Jesuit priests were the ﬁrst to establish direct contact with the native inhabitants. Other reports followed, including that of Gabriel Soares de Souza, who recorded the use of several plants (Souza, 1938). Brazilian territory remained under rigid colonial control until the early 19th century. This policy was intended to conceal the potential of the country’s natural resources from other nations. From 1630 to 1654, northwestern Brazil was occupied by the Dutch. During this period, the physician William Pies described the use of important indigenous drugs, including

jaborandi, ipecac, copaiba and tobacco (Pisonis, 1648). In 1808, Bonaparte’s invasion of Portugal forced the Portuguese royal family to resettle in Rio de Janeiro. Remarkable progress occurred in the economy and in culture and science during the 13 years that they lived in Rio de Janeiro. During this period, foreigners gained permission to enter the country. Several European nat- uralists, artists and scientists travelled in the vast Brazilian territory and recorded the mineral, animal and vegetal resources as well as the customs of the inhabitants. The information gathered by naturalists has contributed signiﬁcantly to the growing knowledge of South American biodiversity and has produced signiﬁcant advances in understanding of the continent’s natural history (Brand~ao et al., 2008, 2011).

Carl Friedrich Phillip von Martius was one of the most prominent naturalists to travel in Brazil. His studies of the country included investigations in botany and anthropology (Schmelz, 2000). He travelled throughout the country, accompa- nied by the zoologist Johann Baptist von Spix. After their arrival in Rio de Janeiro in November 1817, von Martius and Spix travelled

southwards in the direction of S~ao Paulo, proceeded through Minas Gerais over Goia´ s to Bahia, and then travelled farther north to the Amazon. In Fortaleza da Barra do Rio Negro, today’s Manaus, von Martius and Spix separated to make independent journeys to the frontiers of Colombia and Venezuela. In December 1820, they returned to Rio de Janeiro and Munich. The collections made by this important expedition included thousands of natural history specimens. In all, these collections included 86 specimens of mammals, 350 of birds, 130 of amphibians, 116 of ﬁsh, 2700 of insects, 6500 types of plants, minerals and a great number of cultural objects from the native tribes (Tiefenbacher, 1994). A substantial number of important publications in the ﬁelds of botany and other sciences were also produced. These publications still possess extraordinary scientiﬁc value. Von Martius0 compre- hensive work ‘‘Flora brasiliensis’’ (http://ﬂorabrasiliensis.cria.org. br/) remains the most extensive complete publication about the plants of Brazil. The work of more than 60 years and several specialists was required to produce this substantial project, which comprises 15 volumes divided into 40 parts and containing information on 22,267 plant species, primarily Brazilian angios- perms (Wuschek, 1989; Riederer, 2007). The interests of von Martius extended beyond taxonomy to the traditional uses of Brazilian plants (Wuschek, 1989). In this area of study, he published the ‘‘Systema de Materia Medica Vegetabilis Brasilien- sis’’ (Systema) as well as ‘‘Das Naturell, die Krankheiten, das Arztthum und die Heilmittel der Urbewohner Brasiliens’’. The Systema includes detailed descriptions of the origin of popular plant names, scientiﬁc names and the traditional/ medicinal use of 730 species (Martius, 1843).

This study aims to retrieve, organise and update information on medicinal plants from the Amazon described in the Systema and to complement these results with data from other studies published by von Martius. The medicinal use of plants was compared and/or conﬁrmed by referring to relevant correlated pharmacological studies if available.

but are not considered in this study. Additional data were obtained from the travel diaries, published from 1823 to 1831 and ﬁrst translated into Portuguese soon afterwards, in 1838.

2.2. Recent pharmacological studies correlated with traditional uses

Information on these recent studies was obtained from searches of scientiﬁc databases (Pubmed, Scopus, ISI Web of Knowledge).

3. Results

A total of 92 different species were described as medicinal by von Martius in the Amazon (Table 1). The species belong to 38 families. The Leguminosae and Euphorbiaceae are best repre- sented, with 11 and 8 species, respectively. The Lauraceae, Asteraceae, Apocynaceae and Araceae are represented by six, ﬁve, four and four species, respectively. The Cucurbitaceae and Sola- naceae are each represented by three species. The other families are represented by two or one species each.

Traditional uses of the plants were observed in different parts of the Amazon, primarily in villages located near the banks of the Negro, Solim ~oes, Japura´ , Uaupe´ s, Tocantins and Amazon Rivers as well as near larger cities such as Manaus, Bele´ m and Santare´ m. The remedies were prepared from different parts of the plants. As shown in Table 1, the plant parts most frequently used were the roots (18), leaves (16), herbs (16), bark (12), fruits (11) and seeds (9). Different types of exudates from Amazonian trees were also used, including six latex/milk exudates, four juices and four balsam/resin exudates. Von Martius conducted many compari- sons involving several of these exudates. The balsam obtained from Protium heptaphyllum (Aubl.) Marchand (Burseraceae) was compared with elemi and animes (Hymenaea spp.), and Humiria balsamifera Aubl. was compared with Copaifera L.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Ethnopharmacological historical literature survey

The selection of data on Amazonian medicinal plants was based on the Systema de Materia Medicae Vegetabilis Brasiliensis (Martius, 1843). To access information in the Systema is a difﬁcult undertaking because the data are not always logically organised, often appear incomplete, are taxonomically antiquated and are generally presented in Latin, Portuguese or German. In this report, we restrict our investigations to the plants of the Amazon because the naturalists covered a wide geographical area and because data on the medicinal plants of this region are scarce.

Native species for which data on traditional medicinal use were included and the vernacular names of the plants speciﬁed in the Systema were selected for further analysis. The actual bota- nical names were checked in the Flora Brasiliensis http://ﬂorabra siliensis.cria.org.br/ and the websites www.theplantlist.org and www.mobot.org. The status of each species as a plant native to Brazil was veriﬁed in an ofﬁcial Brazilian species list, ‘‘Lista de Espe´cies da Flora do Brasil’’ (Jardim Botˆanico do Rio de Janeiro; http://ﬂoradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br).

The traditional uses described by von Martius (in Latin or German) in the bibliography were summarised from the original books, translated into English and included in Table 1. Particular uses such as ‘‘chlorosis’’ (hypochromic anaemia) or ‘‘alexiphar- maca’’, are described in their original format. The uses of certain exotic species, such as Zingiber ofﬁcinale Roscoe or Sesamum indicum L., were also recorded by von Martius from the Amazon

A total of 117 traditional uses were recorded by von Martius for the plants listed in Table 1. The most common use was the treatment of dermatological problems: 39 plants (42.3% of the total number of species) were used for this purpose. Of these plants, 23 species were found to serve in treating ulcers and in healing wounds and four in treating warts, four were used against condyloma, three were used as emollients, two were used for exanthema disease and two were used for impingments or insect bites. One plant each was mentioned for the treatment of dry skin, dermatophytoses, erysipelas, herpes, psoriasis, burn and sun- stroke. Other plants were recorded as useful for treating digestive disorders. Of these plants, 17 species were found to serve in treating intestinal constipation (for example, as ‘‘counteracting obstructions of the abdominal viscera’’) and as laxatives, purga- tives, cathartics or drastic remedies; 11 species were used as antihelminthics; 7 were used as inducers of vomiting/emetics and to treat dyspepsia/stomachic and other digestive disorders; ﬁve were used as antidiarrheal agents; four were used as carmina- tives/anti-ﬂatulence agents; and one was used against blood dysentery. Other well-documented uses involved water retention and urinary problems. A total of 14 plants were used as diuretics (including treatments for dysuria and stranguria), seven to treat hydrops, seven to treat oedema of the foot, three to treat the pain of nephritis, two to treat gout and one to treat blood in the urine. Traditional uses for treating respiratory diseases were also fre- quently mentioned. the use of three plants was mentioned for each of the following catarrhal diseases: chronic cough, lung debility and tuberculosis. Ten plants were used to treat venereal disease, six of which were used against gonorrhoea and four as antisyphilitics. Nine species were used as diaphoretics, seven as febrifuges/antipyretics (two of which were used against

intermittent fevers), seven to treat rheumatic diseases, ﬁve to treat amenorrhoea/as emmenagogues and ﬁve to treat arthritis/ arthralgia. Other uses were as astringents, as anti-haemorrhoi- dals, to treat lymphedema and leucorrhoea and as neurological, cardiac and ophthalmic remedies. A total of three or four plants were recorded for each of these uses. The other 40 traditional uses were identiﬁed with one or two species. Of the species listed in Table 1, only 33 (35%) have been studied pharmacologically to verify the efﬁcacy of the traditional remedies, but all of the species studied in these investigations showed activity.

4. Discussion and conclusions

Brazil offers an immense amount of biodiversity, including plants with great pharmacological interest, as recorded by several European naturalists who travelled throughout the country during the 19th century. Data on the medicinal uses of plants of southwestern Brazil recorded in the travel diaries of European naturalists have previously been presented (Brand~ao et al., 2008, 2011). In a recent study, we have additionally presented the ﬁrst data on records of Brazilian medicinal plants in the ﬁeld notebook of the French naturalist Auguste de Saint-Hilaire (Brand~ao et al., 2012). The Amazon Basin, in northern Brazil, also has a highly

diverse biota and still harbours a variety of unknown and unstudied plant species (Hopkins, 2007; Schulman et al., 2007). The Germans Spix and von Martius travelled in a vast area of the Amazon (from the frontiers of Colombia and Venezuela to the Brazilian State of Maranh~ao), and they recorded important data about the use of plants by native Brazilians during that period

Table 1 shows traditional uses for 92 Amazonian plant species. This high number most likely reﬂects not only the extensive biodiversity of the area but also von Martius0 knowledge of medicine. The remedies were prepared with different parts of the plants roots, herbs and leaves. It is interesting to note the use of several exudates of the plants, including juice, latex, resin and balsam. Many of these exudates were used to treat different dermatological diseases. The high frequency of exudate use is due to the type of vegetation found in the area of these explorations. The Brazilian Amazon is the largest continuous forest on Earth, representing more than 40% of the world’s existing tropical rainforest and including a great abundance of trees (Rangel, 2012).

Dermatological problems, including leprosy and wounds, were the most frequent diseases in the Amazon region in the 19th century because of the region’s climate (Galv~ao, 2003). In accor- dance with this situation, almost one-half of the recorded plant species (39, 42.3% of the total) were recorded by von Martius as

useful for treating skin infections. Very few of these species have been subjected to any pharmacological evaluation. The species Pistia stratiotes, Ipomoea pes-caprae, Sida cordifolia, Heliotropium indicum, Couroupita guianensis and Rhizophora mangle have been conﬁrmed as effective wound-healing agents. Two species (Hura crepitans and Renealmia alpinia) have also shown activity against leishmaniasis in experimental studies. Note that ethnobotanical studies performed recently in other and different areas of the Amazon have also shown that most of the plants investigated are used to treat skin diseases (Bourdy et al., 2000; Herndon et al., 2009; Valadeau et al., 2009; Luziatelli et al., 2010). As observed by von Martius, these studies also show that plants are frequently used to treat digestive disorders in the Amazon region. Skin infections and digestive disorders are still severe public health problems in several areas of the world, and promising laboratory results indicate that these species can be useful for developing new medicines. Parasitic disease remains a health problem in the Amazon region, as it was in the 19th century, and many plant species used by the population to treat parasitic diseases were recorded by von Martius. Other diseases affecting the population of the Amazon region in the area investigated by von Martius include rheumatism, inﬂuenza, dysentery, diseases and symptoms asso- ciated with insect and snake bites, diseases of the respiratory system (e.g., pneumonia) and digestive disorders (Galv~ao, 2003). Von Martius recorded the use of plants for all these disorders. However, few of these plants have been evaluated to date, and their potential remains to be explored.

refreshing and stimulating drink. The stimulant effect of this drink is due to its high caffeine content. This scarce product obtained from American plants has gained an international market and is now known worldwide (Desmachelier, 2010). The Maue´ s Indians were the ﬁrst inhabitants of the Amazon to develop the preparation of guarana´ , and von Martius was respon- sible for the ﬁrst detailed description of this preparation. This description appears in his travel diaries (Spix and Martius, 1823– 1831).

This study shows that many of the medicinal plants described by von Martius from the Amazon have not been studied in greater detail until recently or have not been studied at all. Unlike other areas of Brazil (e.g., the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado), where the native vegetation has been severely degraded, the Amazon region still preserves its biodiversity. The collections, bibliographic and botanical samples collected by von Martius in the Amazon repre- sent highly valuable and critical materials for the development and conservation of the Amazon region. We also hope that this work will provide an additional incentive for the valuation of the traditional knowledge of the people of the Amazon region and will be useful in the protection of collective intellectual property rights.

Acknowledgements

In contrast to the observations of other European naturalists, only two species (Tachia guianensis and Abuta rufescens) were recorded by von Martius as useful for treating intermittent fevers, the principal symptom of malaria. Both of these species have shown antimalarial activity in in vitro studies (Ruiz et al., 2011; Carvalho et al., 1991). Malaria is currently widespread in the Amazon and is one of the most serious public health problems in that region. The reason for the small number of plants used to treat this disease in the 19th century is that this disease was widespread in other areas of Brazil at that time but not in the Amazon region. The history of malaria is directly related to demographic, ecological, socio-economic and cultural changes in the region beginning in the ﬁrst half of the 20th century. The earliest evidence for malaria in the Brazilian Amazon was pre- sented by the Brazilian naturalist Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira in his work ‘‘Endemic Diseases of the Captaincy of Mato Grosso’’, published in the 18th century. In this work, he describes inter- mittent fevers, ague and related ailments and recommends quina (Cinchona species) as the best febrifuge (Ferreira Jr. et al., in press).

In the 19th century, the principal source of income in the Amazon region was the extraction of native products known as ‘‘hinterland plants’’ (‘‘drogas do sert~ao’’), such as cacao (Theobroma cacao), salsaparrilha (Smilax spp.), annatto (Bixa orellana L.), canela (Cinnamomum spp.), copaiba balsam, vanilla and guarana´ (Emperaire, 2000). Von Martius furnished detailed descriptions of the use of two species of salsaparrilha and two species of copaı´ba balsam by the Brazilians. Salsaparrilha is the vernacular name for different species of Smilax, but von Martius only recorded the use of Smilax longifolia Rich. and Smilax syphilitica Humb. & Bonpl. ex Willd. The roots of these plants are rich in saponins and had great commercial value at the time due to their use as diuretics and for the treatment of venereal diseases. Paul Marcoy was a French botanist who travelled in the 19th century in the same areas of Amazonas von Martius. In his book, ﬁrst published in 1860, he mentioned that many typical Amazon products were already scarce due to excessive collection and that Smilax roots were one of the products showing increasing scarcity (Marcoy, 2006).
