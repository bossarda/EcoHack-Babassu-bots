Abstract The Amazon region’s biodiversity is exploited by the local population, commonly for therapeutic purposes. Given this information, the goal of this study was to perform a systematic review on medicinal plants used in this region, listing the name of the species, location found, and its importance for traditional medicine and for local people. For this, a search was performed in the PubMed/Medline and Lilacs databases, using the descriptors medicinal plants, Amazonia or Amazon region, in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. The main findings demonstrate that different species from different botanical families are used by the local population. The main therapeutic outcomes sought out refer to the search for relief or treatment of gastrointestinal, hepatic alterations, fever, kidney stones, pain, infections, and parasites. Thus, it is concluded that the practice of traditional medicine is very common in the Amazon region and is transmitted orally from generation to generation. In this practice, the use of medicinal plants in the form of tea is highlighted, with the species in the form of powder, dried or natural plants. Therefore, it is recommended that the strengthening of pharmacological studies involving local medicinal plants can provide scientific support for popular knowledge. Keywords: Amazonia; Traditional medicine; Folk knowledge; Ethnopharmacology.

1. Introduction

The Amazon Rainforest is known as the largest forest on Earth and for sheltering the largest river basin in the world.

It is distributed by nine countries in South America, with the largest portion in Brazilian lands (67.8%), where it is called Legal

Amazon and it comprises the states of Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima and

Tocantins (Penna-Filho, 2013).

In addition to all its territory greatness, the Amazon has nine kinds of vegetation, of which Terra Firme Forest is the

most important, since it covers 90% of the Legal Amazon and presents great variation of plant species that were not or are little

explored (Braga, 1979; Penna-Filho, 2013), having them a great potential for generating resources, such as those related to the

pharmaceutical and medical areas.

The potential of using medicinal plants as a treatment for diseases, called phytotherapy, is a practice of traditional

medicine that has been used since the appearance of the human species (Badke et al., 2011), however, over the years and with

the advance of technology, new ways to treat diseases were being developed and the use of medicinal plants became less

common. Nevertheless, phytotherapy practice in Brazil has not lost its relevance despite the great incentives of the

pharmaceutical industry in the country, due to folk knowledge about medicinal plants (Badke et al., 2011).

Additionally, with the advancement of Brazilian health models until the arrival of the Unified Health System, it can be

understood that medicinal plants and herbal medicines have a lot to add in developing countries, as they are important

instruments of pharmaceutical care, since 67% of medicinal plant species in the world originate from developing countries.

Since the past, several notices and resolutions of the World Health Organization (WHO) express the organization's position

regarding the need to value the use of these drugs, in the health field, being observed as a normative basis for the maintenance

of health (Unesco, 2020).

In 2006, the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices was granted in order to establish guidelines

and institutional responsibilities for the implementation/adaptation of actions and services in traditional Chinese

medicine/acupuncture, homeopathy, medicinal plants and phytotherapy, in addition to establishing health observatories for

social thermalism/crenotherapy and for anthroposophical medicine in the Unified Health System (Brasil, 2012).

In line with the above, in 2012, the Brazilian Ministry of Health launched the Primary Care Booklet 31, which guides

the actions to be performed by the Basic Health Units and their professionals, in addition to making a historical overview of

national policies and informing on the norms, guidelines, services and products related to phytotherapy in the Family Health

Strategy/Primary Care. The objective of this is to implement new programs, improving the population's access to safe and

quality products and services; sensitize and guide managers and health professionals in the formation and implementation of

policies, programs, projects and structures that aim to strengthen phytotherapy, with an emphasis on primary care (Brasil,

2012).

In this context, since the Amazon Rainforest is a rich region with a large number of plants and phytotherapy practice

is relevant in Brazil, the goal of this study was to perform a systematic review on medicinal plants used in this region, listing

the name of the species, location found, and its importance for traditional medicine and for local people.

2. Methodology

The study is a systematic review of scientific articles on medicinal plants found in the Amazon region, which are used

in folk medicine; and it was made following the recommendation for PRISM reports of systematic reviews and meta-analyses

(Moher et al., 2009).

Eligible studies were identified in searches carried out on July 4, 2019, in the PubMed/Medline (National Library of

Medicine, Bethesda, MD) and Lilacs (Latin American and Caribbean Literature on health sciences) databases. The keyword

combinations used in database searches, covering the Portuguese, Spanish and English languages, used in accomplishment

researches were (“Plantas medicinais”) AND (“Amazonia OR região amazonica”), (“Plants medicinal”) AND (“Amazon OR

amazon region”) and (“Plantas medicinales”) AND (“Amazon OR región amazónica”). In this research, all items were

identified, regardless of study design.

The criteria for inclusion were data about the medicinal plants of the Amazon region, which are used by folk medicine

for the treatment of diseases. Additionally, the exclusion criteria used were divided into three categories. First, data with a

publication period before 2009. Second, review articles, historical documents, theses, and dissertations, considering only

scientific articles. Third, escape from the theme of the present study, as well as data published without location information,

locations outside of the Amazon region, lack of scientific names of medicinal plants and data that does not demonstrate the use

of medicinal plants by population, with based on reading the title and abstract of the article.

The selected articles were evaluated by the reviewers considering the reading and careful analysis of the full text, by

removing those who deliberate the exclusion criteria adopted. Still, the existence of data duplication in the same database and

between databases was checked, and each item was counted only once. The information to be removed from articles included

in the study were the names of plant species, the reason for its use, and how it was used, according to the Amazon region.

The results were described in a table, listing the characteristics of the botanical family, the plant species, the purpose

of the study, the medicinal use, the form of preparation of the medicinal plant, the route of administration, the location found

and the authors and year of the articles (Table 1).

3. Results

After the use of the above descriptors in the databases, 311 published articles were identified between January 1,

2009, and the date of search (July 4, 2019), of which 39 were repeated and were counted only once. After deleting them, there

were 272 remaining items, of which 36 were not scientific articles. Then, reading the titles and summaries of other 236 articles,

to identify which did not fit the criteria for inclusion, data about the medicinal plants of the Amazon region, which are used by

folk medicine for the treatment of diseases. After this analysis, 51 items remained. With the reading of the articles in their

entirety, there were 13 items left which were included in this review, because the others didn't bring the information about the

medicinal plants of the Amazon region, which are used by folk medicine for the treatment of diseases (Figure 1).

The results obtained regarding the botanical family, the main species, the purposes of the studies, the medicinal use,

the form of use and the local application of medicinal plants in the Amazon region are listed in Table 1.

4. Discussion

Ethnobotany is considered an important area of science, as it studies the ecological and cultural influences of plants

from ancient and modern society, with great repercussions in pharmacology. In this context, ethnobotanical research extracts

information about folk knowledge regarding plants so that studies that aim their beneficial use can be carried out. Thus, in

addition to valuing folk knowledge, it can develop technologies to take advantage of these sustainable resources (Cragg;

Newman, 2013).

One of the most important practices related to ethnobotany is called a blessing, which is a healing alternative practiced

by women, usually called folk healers, who aim to heal through the use of plants and religion (Júnior et al., 2013). According

to the evolutionary process, it is observed that women have most of the knowledge of the use of medicinal plants and, thus, the

responsibility to take care of family health falls on them (Vásquez et al., 2014) Therefore, the main source of medicinal plants

are the backyards of the houses, being them cultivated directly from the ground or flower beds, and, in the background, the

forest also ends up serving as a means of access (Carniello et al., 2010).

In the Amazon region, which is home to various indigenous tribes, this practice is widely used by shamans, usually in

rituals associated with supernatural factors. In addition to that, plants are also used as amulets, to scare the evil eye, during

childbirth and religious rituals (Rocha, 2014). In this place, the knowledge related to the use of medicinal plants is orally

transmitted from generation to generation (Freitas, 2014), that is, this knowledge is part of the culture of most people.

In this context, there are studies that indicate a national trend of deficit of scientific knowledge on the part of health

professionals and the general population regarding Integrative and Complementary Practices, and a large part of pre-existing

knowledge is conditioned to knowledge passed on through parental relationships and/or isolated events (Goés; Silva; Castro,

2019).

In this region, the main way of preparing medicinal plants is tea, which can be prepared in four main ways: (1)

infusion, which consists of putting the contents of the plant in boiling water for 15-20 minutes, letting it rest for 5-10 minutes

and then straining it is more used for the soft parts of plants, such as flowers or leaves; (2) decoction, which consists of placing

the material in cold water and cooking it for 5-30 minutes and then straining it, is indicated for the hard parts of the plant, such

as stems, roots, and barks; (3) maceration, which consists of placing the contents in cold water for 10-24 hours and then

straining it is used for different parts of the plant, such as flowers, leaves, seeds, stems, roots, and barks; (4) herbal tea, which

consists of placing the contents in a pan with boiling water for 5 minutes and then straining it, is used for herbs (Who, 2018).

Medicinal plants are often used in powder form, made from the dried plant, since crushing and sifting is necessary.

Then, this powder can be used to prepare infusions, decoctions, or oils. Besides, juices are also widely used, needing only to

have its herbs crushed and then strained. Syrups are prepared with a mixture of 50% juice, decocted or macerated, and 50%

honey. As a form of external use, poultice stands out, a form in which fresh or dried herbs are used, which is placed directly on

the spot you want it. The bath is also an external use form, because despite being prepared from an infusion, instead of

ingesting it, it is used to wash the body (Who, 2018).

Other ways of using medicinal plants involve inhalation, which consists of placing the contents in boiling water and

slowly inhaling the released steam, and tincture intake, prepared as if it were a maceration, but using alcohol, preferably

cereals, being consumed in drops diluted in cold water, ointments, or rubs. The tincture form is the one that most preserves the

active principles of medicinal plants, since most are soluble in alcohol (Who, 2018).

Even with people’s access to traditional medicine, medicinal plants are still widely used for maintaining health in

some communities in the Amazon (Vásquez et al., 2014). In this study, the main botanical families used in this region were

analyzed with Fabaceae being the most frequent, presenting species pointed out by the population as effective in the treatment

13

Research, Society and Development, v. 10, n. 14, e163101419965, 2021 (CC BY 4.0) | ISSN 2525-3409 | DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.33448/rsd-v10i14.19965

of gastrointestinal alterations, it is usually used in the form of infusing or cooked (in the colloquial language) for cases of

diarrhea and abdominal pain. In addition, they are species used to treat infections, inflammations, liver disorders, and even

cancer (Frausin et al., 2015; Gois et al., 2016; Rengifo-Salgado et al., 2017) (Table 1, columns 1, 2, and 4).

The Euphorbiaceae and Rubiaceae families described in different studies are identified by the population as useful for

liver, gallbladder, stomach, and kidneys’ alterations relief, in addition to pain and fever reducing. These species are mainly

used in the forms of decoction, macerated or infused (Odonne et al., 2013; Santos et al., 2014; Castillo, 2015; Giovannini,

2015) (Table 1, columns 1, 2, and 4).

Species of the Solanaceae Family are listed by the population as effective for treating rheumatic alterations and

reducing fungal infections. The main ways of preparing and using these species are tea, juice, poultice, and tincture (Polesna et

al., 2011; Castillo, 2015; Gois et al., 2016) (Table 1; columns 1, 2, and 4).

Different species belonging to the Asteraceae, Annonaceae, Poaceae and Burseraceae botanical families have been

reported to have analgesic potential, to reduce stomach pain and improve gastritis, being prepared in various forms, such as

infusion or decoction (Veiga et al., 2015; Gois et al., 2016; Rengifo-Salgado et al., 2017; Mesquita et al., 2018) (Table 1;

columns 1, 2, and 4).

The Rhamnaceae and Apocynaceae families present botanical species used by the population for the treatment of

malaria, that represents an endemic disease for the Amazon region which can be explored by parasitic research groups, so that

better therapies against it can be developed (Oliveira et al., 2015; Veiga et al., 2015; Gois et al., 2016) (Table 1; columns 1, 2,

and 4).

Other botanical families were listed by the Amazon region population and were used for intestinal and respiratory

disorders, anemia, headaches, and fever, among others (Table1). This knowledge, full of inaccuracies, especially with regard to

the method of preparation, indications and scope of the use of plants and herbal medicines, can lead to treatment failure,

leading to a future disbelief in the use of this type of treatment by the patient. (Santos; Léda; Oliveira, 2018).

Folk knowledge about medicinal plants has awakened governmental interest, a fact that has supported policies that

aim to highlight the importance of alternative medicine for more effective and humanizing health care (Brazil, 2000).

Furthermore, there is still a lack of scientific studies that prove the pharmacological properties of the various medicinal plants

existing in Brazil, in order to inform the correct dose to be used, the proper method of preparation, the maximum time that it

can be stored, the indications and possible drug interactions that may exist with both pharmacy drugs and other medicinal

plants

In this sense, Práticas Interativas e Complementares em Saúde (PICS) [Integrative and Complementary Health

Practices] were implemented to integrate different medical practices, such as traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, and

herbal medicine, among others (Telesi-Júnior, 2016). PICS aim to expand therapeutic options to users of the Sistema Único de

Saúde (SUS) [Unified Health System], while one of its strategies is to provide access to medicinal plants safely and efficiently

(Rodrigues et al., 2006) which was further reinforced by the Programa Nacional de Plantas Medicinais e Fitoterápicos

[National Program for Medicinal Plants and Herbal Medicines].

The demand for PICS has increased due to its power to guide the doctor-patient relationship as an important element

in therapy, it values simple therapeutic forms, it is less dependent on technologies, and increases the patient’s autonomy over

the healing process itself (Levin et al., 2001; Nogales-Gaete, 2004; Santos et al., 2012).

Folk medicine study, especially of herbal medicines, has received greater attention from pharmacological research, as

they have provided science with a greater amount of information regarding active principles (Vale, 2002). In this sense, folk

knowledge provides the basis for advances in the fields of therapeutics, emphasizing the importance of updates on traditional

medicine.

The limitations of the study involve the difficulty of obtaining more complete information about the plant species used

in the Amazon region in published articles, in the sense of correlation with therapeutic use, the chosen plant parts, forms of

preparation, route of administration, among others.

5. Conclusion

Traditional medicine, practiced through the use of medicinal plants, proves to be of great importance for the Amazon

region population, so much so that it is a factor present in the culture of these people and that is passed on from generation to

generation. This proves how important this practice is for complementing official medicine. In this sense, it is concluded that

the practice of traditional medicine is very common in the Amazon region and is transmitted orally from generation to

generation. In this practice, the use of medicinal plants in the form of tea is highlighted, with the species in the form of powder,

dried or natural plants. Thus, this study serves as a basis for more in-depth pharmacological investigations to be developed

based on the information cited. Therefore, it is suggested that the strengthening of pharmacological studies involving local

medicinal plants can provide scientific support for popular knowledge.
