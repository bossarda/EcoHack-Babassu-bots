def extract_information(text):
    """
    This function takes a string of text as input and uses the OpenRouter model
    to extract information on plants mentioned in the text.
    """
    prompt1 = f"""
    Objective: Efficiently extract detailed information about ALL plant or animal species that can be used for medicinal purposes described in a document.

    Data to Extract: If there is a species with medicinal purpose described in the text, summarize any available information on the species such as:

    Species Name: Record both the scientific and any common names.
    Medicinal Uses: Include descriptions of use, which illnesses can be treated, and the specific parts utilized.
    Habitat: Note the geographical location or habitat, such as ecosystems, of each species.
    Citations: List any publications or studies that reference the species.
    Additional Data: Capture extra details such as preparation methods and dosages.

    Instructions:

    Focus on accurately transferring data without interpretation. Where specific details are unavailable, only include a summary of the available information.
    If no species with medicinal use is present in the text, return "no information about species with medicinal use" and no other output.

    These are examples of input and desired output:
    Input 1: "The plant with the scientific name Opus popus, commonly known as wallflower, grows in the Brasilian rainforest. It is most commonly found in secondary forests.
    It is reportedly used by the indigenous population to treat various illnesses such as indigestion or headaches (Albus et al., 2011). It can be consumed as a tea, but the dosage needs to be
    carefully chosen because an overdose can cause hallucinations. This is not the only plant that can be used to make tea. Other popular plants that can be used to make tea
    include strawberry leaves, peppermint, and cherries.

    Output 1: "Wall flowers (scientific name: Opus popus) are plants that are used by indigenous people to treat illnesses such as indigestion or headaches. The plant is
    found in secondary forests of the brasilian rainforest. It is consumed as a tea. The correct dosage is important to prevent side effects like hallucinations. Citation: Albus et al., 2011

    Input 2: " Lay down these words

    Before your mind like rocks.
    placed solid, by hands
    In choice of place, set
    Before the body of the mind
    in space and time:
    Solidity of baby, lint, or wall
    riprap of things:
    Cobble of milky way,
    straying planets,
    These poems, people,
    lost ponies with
    Dragging saddles —"

    Output 2: "no information about species with medicinal use"

    Input 3: "In the lush Amazon rainforest, the towering Brazil nut trees stand as guardians of the diverse ecosystem. Scarlet macaws, with their vibrant plumage, soar through the canopy, while howler monkeys leap from branch to branch, filling the air with their distinctive calls. On the forest floor, jaguars prowl stealthily, their rosetted coats blending into the dappled shadows. Nearby, colorful poison dart frogs hop among the leaf litter, their bright hues a warning to predators. The rainforest is also home to the elusive harpy eagle, whose powerful talons grasp the branches as it scans for prey. Beneath the water's surface, pink river dolphins navigate the winding tributaries, sharing the waters with schools of piranhas. This rich tapestry of plant and animal life highlights the incredible biodiversity of the Amazon, where every species plays a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance of this unique environment."
    Output 3: "no information about species with medicinal use
